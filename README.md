# process

| Concept       | Description                                       | Example                              |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| **Process**   | A running instance of a program managed by the OS | JVM running your Java app            |
| **Program**   | Static set of instructions on disk                | `MyApp.jar`                          |
| **Thread**    | Execution unit within a process                   | `Thread-0`, `main`                   |
| **Isolation** | Each process has its own memory space             | JVM separate from Chrome             |
| **Lifecycle** | Created ‚Üí Running ‚Üí Waiting ‚Üí Terminated          | `java` starts and exits after main() |


# thread 
| Concept              | Description                                                       | Example / Note                  |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| **Thread**           | Smallest unit of CPU execution within a process                   | Java‚Äôs `Thread` or `Runnable`   |
| **Main Thread**      | Runs `main()` method                                              | Always created by JVM           |
| **Thread Lifecycle** | NEW ‚Üí RUNNABLE ‚Üí RUNNING ‚Üí WAITING ‚Üí TERMINATED                   | Controlled by JVM scheduler     |
| **Shared Memory**    | Threads share heap; have separate stacks                          | Can lead to race conditions     |
| **Concurrency**      | Multiple threads executing logically at the same time             | Useful for multitasking         |
| **Parallelism**      | Threads executing *physically* at the same time on multiple cores | True simultaneous execution     |
| **Thread Cost**      | Lightweight compared to processes                                 | But not free ‚Äî manage carefully |


# Threads vs Processes

| Feature            | **Process**                             | **Thread**                           |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| **Memory Space**   | Each process has its own memory         | Threads share memory                 |
| **Creation Cost**  | High (OS allocates new memory)          | Low (shares existing memory)         |
| **Communication**  | Via IPC (files, sockets)                | Direct via shared variables          |
| **Failure Impact** | One process crash doesn‚Äôt affect others | One bad thread can crash the process |
| **Concurrency**    | Multi-process parallelism               | Multi-threaded concurrency           |


# Concurrency vs Parallelism

| Concept         | Definition                                                                                                                                |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Concurrency** | Doing *multiple things at once* (structurally overlapping tasks). It‚Äôs about *dealing with* many tasks at once.                           |
| **Parallelism** | Doing *multiple things literally at the same time* (simultaneously using multiple CPUs/cores). It‚Äôs about *executing* many tasks at once. |

| üßç‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è One person cooking and talking on the phone | Switching between cooking and talking (one at a time, but tasks overlap in time) | Two people ‚Äî one cooks, one talks (both actually happening at once) |
| üßµ In code                                        | One thread interleaving tasks                                                    | Multiple threads on different cores truly executing simultaneously  |
