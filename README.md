# process

| Concept       | Description                                       | Example                              |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| **Process**   | A running instance of a program managed by the OS | JVM running your Java app            |
| **Program**   | Static set of instructions on disk                | `MyApp.jar`                          |
| **Thread**    | Execution unit within a process                   | `Thread-0`, `main`                   |
| **Isolation** | Each process has its own memory space             | JVM separate from Chrome             |
| **Lifecycle** | Created ‚Üí Running ‚Üí Waiting ‚Üí Terminated          | `java` starts and exits after main() |


# thread 
| Concept              | Description                                                       | Example / Note                  |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| **Thread**           | Smallest unit of CPU execution within a process                   | Java‚Äôs `Thread` or `Runnable`   |
| **Main Thread**      | Runs `main()` method                                              | Always created by JVM           |
| **Thread Lifecycle** | NEW ‚Üí RUNNABLE ‚Üí RUNNING ‚Üí WAITING ‚Üí TERMINATED                   | Controlled by JVM scheduler     |
| **Shared Memory**    | Threads share heap; have separate stacks                          | Can lead to race conditions     |
| **Concurrency**      | Multiple threads executing logically at the same time             | Useful for multitasking         |
| **Parallelism**      | Threads executing *physically* at the same time on multiple cores | True simultaneous execution     |
| **Thread Cost**      | Lightweight compared to processes                                 | But not free ‚Äî manage carefully |


# Threads vs Processes

| Feature            | **Process**                             | **Thread**                           |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| **Memory Space**   | Each process has its own memory         | Threads share memory                 |
| **Creation Cost**  | High (OS allocates new memory)          | Low (shares existing memory)         |
| **Communication**  | Via IPC (files, sockets)                | Direct via shared variables          |
| **Failure Impact** | One process crash doesn‚Äôt affect others | One bad thread can crash the process |
| **Concurrency**    | Multi-process parallelism               | Multi-threaded concurrency           |


# Concurrency vs Parallelism

| Concept         | Definition                                                                                                                                |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Concurrency** | Doing *multiple things at once* (structurally overlapping tasks). It‚Äôs about *dealing with* many tasks at once.                           |
| **Parallelism** | Doing *multiple things literally at the same time* (simultaneously using multiple CPUs/cores). It‚Äôs about *executing* many tasks at once. |

| ----- | ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1** | **Define a Task**                  | Create a class that implements `Runnable` (or extend `Thread`). | `class MyTask implements Runnable { public void run() { ... } }` |
| **2** | **Create a Thread Object**         | Pass the task to a `Thread` instance.                           | `Thread t = new Thread(new MyTask());`                           |
| **3** | **Start the Thread**               | Call `start()` to tell JVM to run `run()` in a new thread.      | `t.start();`                                                     |
| **4** | **(Optional) Name Thread**         | Helps identify threads in logs/debugging.                       | `new Thread(new MyTask(), "Worker-1");`                          |
| **5** | **(Optional) Synchronize or Wait** | Use `join()` to wait for thread completion.                     | `t.join();`                                                      |
| **6** | **End of Execution**               | Thread terminates automatically when `run()` completes.         | ‚Äî                                                                |


| Feature              | `Runnable`                            | `Callable<V>`                         |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **Return value**     | Cannot return anything (`void run()`) | Returns a value (`V call()`)          |
| **Exceptions**       | Cannot throw checked exceptions       | Can throw checked exceptions          |
| **Method name**      | `run()`                               | `call()`                              |
| **Result retrieval** | Not possible                          | Via `Future.get()`                    |
| **Common use**       | Fire-and-forget tasks                 | Tasks that compute and return results |
